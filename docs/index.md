# PyWeaver Documentation

Welcome to the PyWeaver documentation! PyWeaver is a Python toolkit designed to help you create and maintain well-structured Python projects. It provides tools for project organization, initialization file management, and source file processing.

## Key Features

PyWeaver offers three main tools to help you manage your Python projects:

### File Structure Generation
   - Visualize project directory structures
   - Generate documentation-ready structure diagrams
   - Filter and customize structure output

### Init File Management
   - Automatically generate and maintain `__init__.py` files
   - Collect and organize exports intelligently
   - Support for complex package hierarchies

### File Combining
   - Merge multiple source files with smart content processing
   - Handle comments and docstrings intelligently
   - Support multiple programming languages

## Getting Started

To install PyWeaver:

```bash
pip install pyweaver
```

## Project Goals

PyWeaver aims to:

1. **Simplify Project Organization**: Make it easier to maintain clean, well-organized Python projects.
2. **Automate Boilerplate**: Reduce manual work in managing package structure and initialization.
3. **Enhance Maintainability**: Help projects stay organized as they grow.
4. **Provide Flexibility**: Support different project structures and coding styles.
